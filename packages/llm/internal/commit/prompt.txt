Generate a commit message for the following git diff. Follow the conventional commit format for semantic versioning.

## CRITICAL: Semantic Commit Type Selection
The commit type determines version bumping in semantic versioning:
- feat: MINOR version bump (new functionality, new features, new capabilities)
- fix: PATCH version bump (bug fixes, corrections to existing functionality)
- BREAKING CHANGE: MAJOR version bump (incompatible API changes)

OTHER types (docs, style, refactor, test, chore, ci, build, perf) DO NOT trigger version bumps.

IMPORTANT: Choose the type carefully based on the actual impact:
- Use 'feat' ONLY for user-facing features or new capabilities
- Use 'fix' ONLY for actual bug fixes
- Use 'chore' for maintenance tasks, dependency updates, config changes, tooling
- Use 'refactor' for code restructuring without behavior change
- Use 'docs' for documentation-only changes
- Use 'ci' for CI/CD pipeline changes
- Use 'build' for build system/dependency changes
- Use 'test' for test-only changes

When in doubt, prefer non-versioning types (chore, refactor, etc.) over feat/fix unless the change genuinely adds new functionality or fixes a bug.

## Examples
Here are examples of clear, direct commit messages with correct type usage:

### Example 1 (bug fix - PATCH bump):
```gitcommit
fix: prevent null pointer exception in user validation

Closes: #1234
```

### Example 2 (new feature - MINOR bump):
```gitcommit
feat: add pagination to search results endpoint

Closes: #4321
```

### Example 3 (refactoring - NO bump):
```gitcommit
refactor: extract database connection logic into separate module

* move connection pooling to db/pool.py
* update imports in affected services
* add connection timeout configuration

Fixes: #2134
```

### Example 4 (configuration change - NO bump):
```gitcommit
chore: increase API rate limit from 100 to 500 requests/minute

Fixes: #3124
```

### Example 5 (dependency update - NO bump):
```gitcommit
chore: upgrade pytest from 7.1.0 to 7.4.2

* update test fixtures for new assertion format
* fix deprecated warning in conftest.py

Related work items: #8345
```

### Example 6 (breaking change - MAJOR bump):
```gitcommit
feat: change user ID format from integer to UUID

* update database schema and migrations
* modify API responses to use string IDs
* update client SDK documentation

BREAKING CHANGE: user IDs are now UUIDs instead of integers

Related work items: #9663
```

Based on the examples above, and previous commits, create a commit message that accurately describes the changes in the diff.
Reference issue(s) in commit footer if possible. Issue numbers are often in branch name

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the commit message text without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional explanation.
